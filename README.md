# Rock_Paper_Scissors
Python project involving rock, paper, and scissors game.

This code is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python. It begins by defining visual representations of rock, paper, and scissors using multi-line strings. After displaying a welcome message, the program prompts the user to input their choice: 0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors. The code checks the user's input for validity, if it's not within 0-2, an error message is printed, otherwise, it displays the chosen image.

Then, the program randomly selects the computer's choice using the "randint" function from the random module. The selected image is printed, followed by a comparison of the user's and computer's choices to determine the outcome of the game. If the user wins, it prints "You Win!", if the user loses, it prints "You Lose!", and if it's a draw, it prints "It's a draw!".
